## Usage
#### Using this application is very easy. We are presented with the front page in which the user can input amounts of money for tracking their budget. Once the budget amount has been input, we can click the `"Add funds"` or `"Subtract funds"` button. After doing this, the budget graf will show how the user's budget has been affected.


Using this application is very simple. We are presented with a home page and we are able to see some posts. In order to create a post, we need to create an account or login if we already have one. Clicking on the dashboard or login buttons allow us to reach the login/signup page. Once we are logged in, we are able to create new posts and comment on someone else's post. And the final step is to logout by clicking the logout button.
