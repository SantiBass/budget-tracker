## Usage
#### Using this application is very easy. We are presented with the front page in which the user can input amounts of money for tracking their budget. Once the budget amount has been input, we can click the `"Add funds"` or `"Subtract funds"` button. After doing this, the budget graph will show how the user's budget has been affected.
